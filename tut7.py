# operators in python

#1. Arithmethic operators

# print("7 + 9 is ", 7+9)
# print("7 - 9 is ", 7-9)
# print("7 / 9 is ", 7/9)
# print("7 * 9 is ", 7*9)
# print("9 % 9 is ", 9%9)
# print("7 ** 3 is ", 7**3)
# print("9 // 3 is ", 9//3)

#2. Assingment Operators

# a = 78
# print(a)
# a += 5 # a = a + 5 
# print(a)
# a %= 5
# print(a)

#3. Comparison operators
# a = 5
# b = 5

# print(a==b)
# print(a>b)
# print(a<b)
# print(a>=b)
# print(a<=b)


#4. Logical Operators
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)

#5. Identity Operators
# print(a is not b) ctrl + ?

#6. Membership Operators

# list1 = [5,9,5,2,9,189,9,842,8,0,8,]
# print(52 not in list1)

#7. Bitwise operators

# 0 = 00
# 1 = 01
# 2 = 10
# 3 = 11
# 00
# 11
# --
# 11 = 3
# print(0 & 1) #& is equal to and
print(0 | 3) #| is equal to or
